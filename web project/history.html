            <h3>Early history</h3>
            <p>The internet was first created in the 1960s as the ARPANET Project by the U.S. Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency. ARPANET was the first network to use packet 
              switching, which allowed data transmission to be broken up into smaller packets for more efficient routing.</p>
            <p>In the 1980s, The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) became the standard networking protocols, providing the foundation for the modern internet. 
              This period saw the expansion of networks beyond academic and military institutions, with the creation of NSFNET (National Science Foundation Network) in the United States, 
              which connected research and educational institutions.</p>
            <p>The World Wide Web (WWW) was invented in 1989 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee.October 1990, Tim had written three fundamental technologies that to this day are still being used in the web.</p>
            <p>These three technologies are:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>HTML: </strong>HyperText Markup Language<p class="text-secondary">The Markup Language this site is written in and throughout the web</p></li>
                    <li><strong>URI: </strong>Uniform Resource Identifier<p class="text-secondary">It is an address that is unique, which helps identify each resource on the web. Also known as a URL</p></li>
                    <li><strong>HTTP: </strong>HyperText Transfer Protocol<p class="text-secondary">Allows for the retrieval of linked resources from across the web. Nowaways, <mark>https</mark> is more 
                      common as it provides more security for users</p></li>

                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>The invention of the <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> revolutionized the internet, making it accessible by the general public. It also popularized graphical interfaces to make it
            easier for non-technical users to navigate the internet.</p>
            <p>In the 2000s, the internet saw the rise of platforms such as Wikipedia, Youtube, Facebook, Twitter, etc. transformed the web into a dynamic and participatory space. It allowed the web to 
              be more interactive, and for users to collaborate and share information with each other with greater ease. In the 2010s, with the rise of smartphones, cloud computing became more prevalent
              as initial smartphones could not be as powerful as Personal Computers. Cloud computing gave users access to even greater amount of data and applications from anywhere with an internet 
              connection. Amazon Web Service (AWS) and Google Docs are examples of cloud services.</p>
            <h3>Evolution of the Web</h3>
            <p>So far we've had two stages of the web: Web 1.0 and Web 2.0. Web 1.0 was all about the fetching (obtaining) and reading of information. It was your typical html and css pages that people
              would build. Personal web pages were common, consisting of mainly static pages. Because of this, websites had little interactivity and were one way gateways of information. Information
              could only be served, but end users could not comment or interact with the content.
            </p>
            <p>Then, came Web 2.0, also known as the Participative Social Web, was about reading, writing, creating, and interacting with the end user. There was a sudden shift in how Web pages were
              designed and used. It allowed creaters of user-generated content to build a community surrounding their works.
            </p>
            <h3>Future of the Web</h3>
            <p>The internet is constantly undergoing rapid growth and transformation. We are currently seeing the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) and of Artificial Intelligence (AI). IoT connects
              our everyday objects and devices together to the internet for data collection and automation. AI allows for more dynamic interactions between human and computer such as personal 
              recommendations, personal assistants, and autonomous systems to enhance the internet experience.
